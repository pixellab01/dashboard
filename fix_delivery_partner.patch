--- Fix for Delivery Partner Analysis Table ---

The table has 3 main issues:

1. Table Component (lines 3183-3339):
   - Current: Shows only "Total" column with summed data
   - Should: Show time-based columns (Day/Week/Overall) like StateAnalysisTable
   - Missing: Pagination, proper metrics display

2. Aggregation Function (lines 1995-2139):
   - Current: Only tracks delivered, cancelled, inTransit, rto, other
   - Should: Calculate total_orders, delivered_percent, rto_percent, order_share, etc.
   - Missing: Week calculation logic like in aggregateStatesByTime

3. Data Structure:
   - Current: timePeriods array with simple metrics
   - Should: Match StateAnalysisTable structure with total_orders, percentages

Here are the complete corrected functions:
